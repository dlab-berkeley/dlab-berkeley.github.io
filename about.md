This site may ultimately provide an index of the [Berkeley
D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu)'s online projects. But it'll only happen with
community engagement - please roll up your sleeves and contribute!

Assuming you have ruby installed (you should already have this on OS X 10.9+
and most recent linux distros). *If you want to push directly to the live site
(and have permission)*:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/dlab-berkeley.github.io

Otherwise, make a clone and do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/*<your clone location>*/dlab-berkeley.github.io
    $ (add *sudo* if you're on ruby) gem install github-pages
    $ cd dlab-berkeley.github.io
    $ jekyll serve

**OMG YOU ARE SERVING A LOCAL COPY OF THE SITE AND YOU'LL SEE CHANGES AS YOU
MAKE THEM!**

This is just a "regular" set of text files, and you can manage them in the
"usual" way via GitHub. You can push updates (if you have permission), create a
fork / make pull-requests, and even make minor changes through the web.  For
exmaple, you can [edit this page directly on
GitHub](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/dlab-berkeley.github.io/edit/master/about.md).
(you'll need to be logged in to GitHub first).

You can find out more about the underlying technology at the websites for
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/help)
(start with the non-threatening blocks near the top of the page).
